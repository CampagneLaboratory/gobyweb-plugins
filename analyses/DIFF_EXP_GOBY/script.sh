# This script expects the following variables to be defined:

# IS_TRANSCRIPT = whether alignments were done against a cDNA reference.
# GROUPS_DEFINITION = description of the groups, in the format group-1=sample_i,sample_j/group-2=sample_k,..
# COMPARE_DEFINITION
# ANNOTATION_FILE = file describing annotations in the Goby annotation format.
# ANNOTATION_TYPES = gene|exon|other, specifies the kind of annotations to calculate counts for.
# USE_WEIGHTS_DIRECTIVE = optional, command line flags to have Goby annotation-to-counts adjust counts with weights.

# All output files must be created in the directory where the analysis script is run.
# the script generates one TSV file with the statistics, as well as images for the scatter plots:
# GENE.png
# EXON.png
# OTHER.png
